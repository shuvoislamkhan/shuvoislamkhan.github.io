I'm a curious Math graduate based in Bangladesh who loves diving into the world of data to uncover hidden stories and insights. Fueled by curiosity and a knack for spotting patterns, I enjoy finding creative solutions that help drive smarter decisions. When I was a kid, I enjoyed being around computers and, as I grew up, I kept developing my relationship with them. During my time in college, I started exploring computer programming, but it was only later that I found my passion: Mathematics. Today, I’m a Mathematics graduate and a lifelong learner.<br><br>

Beyond my day-to-day work, I'm deeply interested in exploring how technology can positively impact society. My research focuses on areas like social computing, responsible AI, and natural language processing (NLP). I'm passionate about understanding how people interact with technology, ensuring AI systems are ethical and transparent, and advancing the field of NLP to make communication between humans and machines more natural and effective. I'm always eager to connect with others who share these interests and collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of what's possible!
