## Current Focus: Python & Machine Learning / AI

I am currently engaged in structured self-study and project-based learning in **Python programming** and **Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence**.  
The objective is to develop strong theoretical foundations along with practical implementation skills applicable to data analysis, predictive modeling, and intelligent systems.
