## Current Focus: Python & Machine Learning / AI

I am currently engaged in structured self-study and project-based learning in **Python programming** and **Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence**.  
The objective is to develop strong theoretical foundations along with practical implementation skills applicable to data analysis, predictive modeling, and intelligent systems.

### 📌 Learning Roadmap

**1. Python Programming**
- Core syntax, data types, and control flow  
- Functions, modules, and object-oriented programming  
- Working with files, APIs, and external libraries  
- Numerical computing using `NumPy` and `Pandas`

**2. Data Analysis & Visualization**
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Visualization using `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`

**3. Machine Learning**
- Supervised learning: regression, classification  
- Unsupervised learning: clustering, dimensionality reduction  
- Model evaluation and optimization  
- Feature engineering and pipeline design  

**4. Deep Learning & AI**
- Neural networks and backpropagation  
- Frameworks: `TensorFlow` and `PyTorch`  
- Computer vision and natural language processing  
- Model deployment fundamentals
