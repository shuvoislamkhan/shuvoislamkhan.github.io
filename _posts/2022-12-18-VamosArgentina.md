You missed out on one of your semester final exams, and you lost your closest one just for the cause of future insecurity. You got distracted, and depressed enough to lose hope. Then the night came, after almost eight years since 2014 when you cried for a mysterious soul "Lionel Messi". All your life you wanted to see this. It happened, Finally, it happened, in the best way it could have. The greatest night of my life till date. Argentina win the 2022 world cup. Argentina, You beauty ♥<br><br>

We are the champions. The world cup itself finally got lucky to be in the hands of the GOAT. Lionel Messi! The man, The Myth, The Legend! Take love from a lost soul ♥
<br><br>

What a night to be alive! That is called the ecstasy of life. That is the time to believe that everything will be alright one day. If you deserve something, you will get it somehow. So from now on, let dream more. Dreams do come true if you are passionate enough and work towards it relentlessly.
