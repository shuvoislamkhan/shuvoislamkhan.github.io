May be things are not going too well in your life. Maybe your surroundings aren't perfect for you, maybe you're surviving with your personal life or academic career, maybe your CG isn't good enough as you expected, maybe your partner is a psycho, maybe you’ve been cheated on. But you’re reading this post with your eyes, scrolling the feed with your hands, you can talk, hear, you’re alive. You aren’t blind. Do you know how it feels to be blind, deaf or dumb? Well you don’t know, cause Allah didn’t let that happen.<br><br>

You’re alright, you’re not preparing tonight to take a chemotherapy tomorrow. You don't have the feelings of those who are still surviving in the ICU. You’re not suffering from any disease that can’t be cured, doctors haven’t told that you don’t have much time left.<br><br>

Life can't be generous to you all the time. Stop roaming around so casually. You have no idea what real scenerio looks like; people actually hurt enough to take their own lives because of it.<br><br>

Take a deep breath. You've your family and your beloved ones besides you. Have a cheatchat with your family, friends and your beloved ones.<br><br>

And, just be thankful to HIM for all the good things you have. Things may not be good for now.But can be best, it will be best, Insha'Allah. Keep us in your prayer. 🤲<br><br>
