I forgot last when someone called me to give a good news. I cannot remember last when I got excited about something. I forgot last when I made a hang out with friends and talked about random girls, music, politics or sports. I forget last when I joined any family or social programme.<br><br>

In the most severe pain of my personal life, I used to think that I should get busy to escape from all the anxiety. I got busy with shitty things, tried to grow empathy on me and started taking on challenges. But now I got a life with an ample amount of anxiety and uncertainty every now and then.<br><br>

Then comes the thought of compensation. I feel I am not compensated properly either. And most surprisingly, at some point compensation has started to become immaterial to me.<br><br>

In my last few years timeline, Everything wasn't going smoothly as I wish. Many unlucky/shitty things happened, between this I somehow managed to survive. And the most painful thing is that once I used to go to bed with stress. Now the time has changed. I wake up with stress as well.<br><br>
